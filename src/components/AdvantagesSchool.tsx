              A huge advantage of our school is its own teaching methodology. We have developed our own style of teaching surfing, which allows beginners to get on the board as quickly as possible.
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              It was our methodology and our teachers that allowed us to pass the certification of the Canary Islands Surfing Federation - FEDERACIÃ“N CANARIA DE SURF. This means that our school meets all international standards. Recertification is carried out annually and this allows us to always strive to improve training.
