          Our surf school teachers are among the best surfers in the Canary
          Islands. Among them is the European longboard champion, who will
          happily share his experience with both beginners and more experienced
          surfers. All members of the teaching staff are certified members of
          the Canary Islands Surfing Federation. Some of them know Russian,
          which definitely positions us as a Russian surf school abroad!

          This is the best place in Spain to learn to surf. In addition to the
          huge Atlantic waves that come here in winter and autumn, Fuerteventura
          also boasts many shallow, calm lagoons, perfect for teaching beginner
          surfers.
          <br />
          <br />
          Surfing in the Canary Islands is available all year round - there are
          always waves and suitable weather here. Moreover, both a real pro and
          a beginner can find a wave that is suitable for the level. It is no
          coincidence that it is believed that this particular place is best
          suited for training; here it is possible to move to the next level
          without difficulties.
          <br />
          <br />
          While listing the advantages, one cannot ignore the fact that
          Fuerteventuraâ€™s beaches are the longest in the Canaries. As a result,
          it is impossible to imagine them overcrowded with tourists. You will
          only come across those who, like you, will be interested in one goal -
          learning to surf.

          The main advantages of our Russian school are the high quality of
          teaching and organization of classes, safety (all our clients are

          course of study), including soft, safe boards for beginners. <br />

          First, we determine the level of skating and physical fitness and only
          then we draw up a training program. And we can assure you that after
          the training is over, you will not only get a lot of great sensations,
          but this level will also rise to a new level.{" "}
